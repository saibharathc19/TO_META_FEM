# Design of Materials using Topology optimization
In this project, design of materials using Topology optimization is carried out in Python through Finite Element Method (FEM).

In this, 2D- materials with extreme properties such as bulk modulus and negative Poisson ratio are obtained using topology optimization by minimizing the compliance tensor.
